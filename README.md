I am using the kali linux in which nmap is already installed, i checked the version of the nmap.
Then I ran the command to get the local ip address.
Thirdly, ran the scan using nmap on the local ip address.
In this step, i started the wireshark and capture some packets.
Researched about the open ports and the vulnerabilities related to the service and their versions.
Lastly, saved the output to the text file.

Learning Outcomes : 
1. Learned about different nmap switches for eg. -T, -A and so on.
2. Learned about packet capturing using wireshark.
3. Learned about saving the scan output to a text file.
